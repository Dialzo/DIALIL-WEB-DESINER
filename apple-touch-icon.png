# Apple Touch Icon
# This file should be replaced with an actual 180x180 PNG image
# for the Apple Touch Icon when the site is added to iOS home screen

# Current placeholder - replace with actual icon
# Size: 180x180 pixels
# Format: PNG
# Background: Solid color or transparent
# Content: Logo or icon representing the site

# For now, the site uses the logo.jpg as fallback
# To create a proper Apple Touch Icon:
# 1. Create a 180x180 PNG image
# 2. Use your logo or a simplified version
# 3. Ensure it looks good on both light and dark backgrounds
# 4. Replace this file with the actual image
